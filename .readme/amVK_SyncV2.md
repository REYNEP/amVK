  In Vulkan it's your responsibility to properly synchronize access to resources.  
  ( This can sound scary if you're a beginner, but don't worry.  I'll dispel the fog for you )  
  The primary thing you synchronize access to are the images you're rendering to and the images you are presenting.  
  There are many means of synchronization in Vulkan, but for this task we'll use semaphores ( VkSemaphore ).
