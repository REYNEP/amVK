For now, I found a WorkAround if anyone is Interested,     USING TextMate-Grammer that VSCODE has Support for:
>Its Pretty much HardCoded based on What Characters are what..... Not really related to Fonts having the Italic Variations or not.... But at least it can FIX THE Emojis ðŸ˜‰

## NOTES
- A REGEX Example: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-textmate/blob/main/test-cases/first-mate/fixtures/javascript-regex.json
[This is where I Got a LIVESAVING Sudden thought]
EXPLANATION:
    - I was using like    "\p{^ASCII}"     cz apple's textmate documentation only wanted that
    - But json actually is different,      json needs DOUBLE BACKSLASHES
    - SO LIFE-SAVING!!!!! (like TIME-TRAVEL!!!!)

- HOW DO YOU DOU     !this-logic      (Negative/Reverse/Not)?
    - https://superuser.com/questions/477463/is-it-possible-to-use-not-in-a-regular-expression-in-textmate

    - Or just mainly use    ^    (yes this Character)    whenever you can    [In most places you can & Should]
</br>

- These are the TEXTMATE Grammatical Options: https://macromates.com/manual/en/language_grammars

- **Then for any theme that makes COMMENTS Italic     you can use the scope that you just created, in my case that would be**  `comment.non-ascii.cpp`

- Well, you can choose any of the 'Character Property [3.]'    from     [TextMate Expressions](https://macromates.com/manual/en/regular_expressions)
