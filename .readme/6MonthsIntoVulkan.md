- Introduction to the Vulkan Computer Graphics API by Mike Bailey (SIGGRAPH 2020) (Video ain't that cool, [SLIDES](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~mjb/vulkan/Handouts/FULL.1pp.pdf) are really fast
- [WIP](https://developer.nvidia.com/sites/default/files/akamai/gameworks/VulkanDevDaypdaniel.pdf) - I am gonna add the Slide 37 from there smtime soom on this README page
- [WIP](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/api-without-secrets-introduction-to-vulkan-part-2.html) Will have to cover this too
- [WIP](https://www.jeremyong.com/c++/vulkan/graphics/rendering/2018/03/26/how-to-learn-vulkan/) Bold Lines from here.... and how he directly tells to start with SHADERS

## Git Commands:
```shell
    git add .                   #'Stage' changes
    git restore --staged .      #revert Staged changes

    git commit                  #'Commit' Locally
    git reset HEAD~1 --soft     #reverse of commit,  still changed will be in Staged state

    git commit --amend          #add the newly Staged changed to this commit that wasn't pushed

    git push                    #github.com/REYNEP/amVK.git will be updated/downgraded by commits
    git pull                    #your repo will be updated/downgraded by commits

    git log
    git status
    git diff
    git show

    #smth about git https://github.blog/2020-12-17-commits-are-snapshots-not-diffs/
    #This is why you cant have manual diffs.... cz commits are snalshots not diffs
    #when you try to see a diff, it is calculated on your Processor locally, ig....
    #hell, i even tried this and knowledge from w3modding times https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Interactive-Staging
```


## VSCODE
- If U R using VSCode /w C/C++ Ext (for VSCode), & you use CMake 
    - U'ld also install that CMakeTools Extension 
    - or U'll need to set includePath & defines in your [c_cpp_proprties.json](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/c-cpp-properties-schema-reference) 
    (note: if you open a folder in vscode, that folder a.k.a. the Project can have a `.vscode` folder which can have `settings.json`, but `c_cpp_properties.json` is a C/C++ Extension specific file....)

- C/C++ Extension comes with its own EnhancedColorization option. But those are not Overridable using the VSCode API as of 2021 November. So I opened an [issue135599](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/135599)
    - Which was a total failure, By The Way....

> I came across a [Less-Contrasty] theme for VSCODE: [EvaTheme by fisheva](https://github.com/fisheva/Eva-Theme)
> OR, if you want Cool Contrasty themes, ask [vrecusko](https://github.com/vrecusko) ðŸ˜‰

- If you are searching on GITHUB, it Has a problem, Sometimes it won't show stuffs from BIG files when you search like vkCreateInstnace in trampoline.c

- ```"files.exclude": {
        "**/build": true
    },
    ```
    this disabled 'find Definition to search for stuffs in specific folders.... **/ means workspacefolder i guess'
