> Let's say that you have created a VkInstance and VkDevice.... Whats next to do? Well if you come from OpenGL you already know whats after Creating OpenGL Context (Similar to VkInstance and VkDevice Creation in VULKAN)

Maybe you already have the idea of whats next.... or you just guessed it.... or you are in a loop or paradox guessing yourself.... or your head and brain is just so Blunt that you cant literally think of anything.... maybe you lost the hope.... Dont, Dont do that. Dont lose the [Hope....](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yLOid9iiwE) 

And if you already lost hope in the past and its been Months since you have done anything.... Then know that thats okay.... The path to wherever you truely wish to go, truely wish to be, is never easy

In many cases when you cant just think about anything. its better to ReGroup with your Thoughts.... past ones, why you started to do all these shits that are trying to take your life....

so our question now Becomes, 'How do we create a Window that shows 3D stuffs or 2D or Images or maybe just the UI'

In many cases its Just better to SET 'Where we goin' - Then simply Traceback, the RoadMap becomes so lucid

Now, before you get to the next stuffs down the road (or towards the Sky).... You need to gear up....
This is smth FUN to read: [https://www.fasterthan.life/blog/tag/Vulkan] (Specially PART III, That gives you all the IDEA over almost all the shitty/fixed/headHurting/MindF*ckin stuffs & WITH FUN!!!!)


# so, DESTINATION .... vkCmdDraw: The first things to Remember
Now, Vulkan is not smth, that you can just easily Traceback if you dont have any prior Knowledge of 3D Stuffs, like... BLENDER or OpenGL or UnrealEngine
And, it is not smth that you can WHOLE-LY understand months.... at this point.... and I blame the Lack of COOL-Enough Resources [IDKWHY But nobody seems to Try making smth like Lectures from DAVID J. MALAN on this Topic]
