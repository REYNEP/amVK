    Introduction to the Vulkan Computer Graphics API by Mike Bailey (SIGGRAPH 2020) (Video ain't that cool, [SLIDES](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~mjb/vulkan/Handouts/FULL.1pp.pdf) are really fast
    [WIP](https://developer.nvidia.com/sites/default/files/akamai/gameworks/VulkanDevDaypdaniel.pdf) - I am gonna add the Slide 37 from there smtime soom on this README page
    [WIP](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/api-without-secrets-introduction-to-vulkan-part-2.html) Will have to cover this too
    [WIP](https://www.jeremyong.com/c++/vulkan/graphics/rendering/2018/03/26/how-to-learn-vulkan/) Bold Lines from here.... and how he directly tells to start with SHADERS

    git commit --amend       #add the newly Staged changed to this commit that wasn't pushed

    git push    #github.com/REYNEP/amVK.git will be updated/downgraded by commits
    git pull    #your repo will be updated/downgraded by commits

    #smth about git https://github.blog/2020-12-17-commits-are-snapshots-not-diffs/
    #This is why you cant have manual diffs.... cz commits are snalshots not diffs
    #when you try to see a diff, it is calculated on your Processor locally, ig....
    #hell, i even tried this and knowledge from w3modding times https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Interactive-Staging
