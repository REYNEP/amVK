 * NOW:
 *   only filter/find memoryTypeIndex for now
 *   \note this Could have been part of amVK_DeviceMK2    but for now lets just have it here
 * 
 * FUTURE:
 * we only handle the MemoryHeap management here.... a.k.a if its full
 *      but we don't store stuffs like size and etc. we only like check if result is MEMORY OVERFLOW or smth. 
 *          and let you ask for what heap has how much left
 * 
 *
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * - ## Memory Allocation
    1. The number of total allocations is fixed by the driver, and can be a number as low as 1024.
    2. So we gonna use VMA [Vulkan Memory Allocator] (by AMD) & use SubAllocation
    3. The VMA library abstracts this slightly for us, but itâ€™s still very important to know.

/**
 * | -------------------------------------- |
 *  SOMETHING ABOUT LOADING Vulkan Functions 
 * | -------------------------------------- |
 * 

You may need to configure the way you import Vulkan functions.

By default, VMA assumes you you link statically with Vulkan API. 
If this is not the case, #define VMA_STATIC_VULKAN_FUNCTIONS 0 before #include of the VMA implementation and use another way.

You can #define VMA_DYNAMIC_VULKAN_FUNCTIONS 1 and make sure vkGetInstanceProcAddr and vkGetDeviceProcAddr globals are defined. 
All the remaining Vulkan functions will be fetched automatically.

Finally, you can provide your own pointers to all Vulkan functions needed by VMA using structure member VmaAllocatorCreateInfo::pVulkanFunctions, 
if you fetched them in some custom way e.g. using some loader like Volk.
